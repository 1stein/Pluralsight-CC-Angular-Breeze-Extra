===================================

Supporting files for the Pluralsight "SPA with Angular and Breeze" course by John Papa. 

The files included in this repository are intended to help streamline the learning process of the Pluralsight course SPA with Angular and Breeze. During the course you will create the Web project from scratch
and create the app logic using JavaScript. The course will ask you to add supporting files (found here) to jump-start the process and keep you focused on the core material of Angular and Breeze.
